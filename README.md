# browserFuzz
A simple python2 fuzzer for browsers, the set-up is still hard-coded to run against chromium.

The logic for genAttr() was inspired by a Javascript fuzzer I saw, but I do not remember what it was called.

This hasn't found anything that I could reliably reproduce so I decided to make it public.
